# Rumor-tg

A telegram bot that makes [Rumor](https://github.com/protolambda/rumor), an eth2 networking shell, available to telegram users through chat!

Uses new experimental rumor features. You may need to checkout a special Rumor branch.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is mostly a fun experiment to test p2p networking things as a group in telegram.
*Running this enables random people from the internet to join and exploit any p2p network from the Rumor host.*
